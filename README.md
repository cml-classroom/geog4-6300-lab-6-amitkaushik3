* Question 1: Good<p>
* Question 2: I appreciate the different color schemes! `tmap arrange` works pretty well, though you might get rid of the hex borders to make the colors pop out more.<p>
* Question 3: Nice use of actual geography here.<p>
* Question 4: This is a good summary of the models.<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: Explained well<p>
* Question 7: Nice use of Moran's I! I would also say that trying to understand how the coast might be influencing results could be an adjustment to the model, as it might be that you just haven't included all relevant variables.<p>
* Question 8: Good<p>
* Question 9: Nicely done.<p>
* Challenge: You've gotten most of the way there on this! Need to also include interpretation.<p>
<p>
General feedback: Marked as complete. Hopefully ChatGPT helped you understand the tests better--not just provide an interpretation.
